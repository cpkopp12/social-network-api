# social-network-api
## Description
This is a back end for a social networking site, where users can share their thoughts or their reactions to other user's thoughts. The users are also able to add and remove friends. The server is set up using mongo, mongoose, and express. There is no front-end for this server, so it will not be deployed as a live application and a walk through video is provided below to demonstrate the back end functionality through Insomnia.
